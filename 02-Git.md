Deleting Branch in GIT: 

  

To delete a branch in Git, you can use the `git branch -d` command followed by the name of the branch you want to delete. For example, if you want to delete a branch named `my-branch`, you can run the following command: 

  

``` 

git branch -d my-branch 

``` 

  

If the branch has not been merged yet, you may need to use the `-D` option instead of `-d` to force the deletion: 

  

``` 

git branch -D my-branch 

``` 

  

This will permanently delete the branch and all of its commits, so make sure you don't need it anymore before running this command. 

  

Detached HEAD: 

  

When you checkout to a specific commit in Git, you are said to be in a "detached HEAD" state. This means that your current state is not pointing to the branch head, but rather to a specific commit.  

  

In this state, any changes you make will not be associated with a branch, and if you make a new commit, it will not be on any branch and may be lost if you switch to another branch.  

  

Here's an example of how you can end up in a detached HEAD state: 

  

1. You create a new branch called "feature" from the "master" branch: `git checkout -b feature` 

2. You make some changes, commit them, and push them to the remote repository: `git commit -m "some changes"; git push origin feature` 

3. You checkout a specific commit in the "feature" branch: `git checkout <commit_hash>` 

4. Now you are in a detached HEAD state, and any changes you make will not be associated with the "feature" branch. 

  

To get back to the "feature" branch, you can use the following command: `git checkout feature`. This will move your HEAD back to the "feature" branch head and any changes you make will be associated with the branch again.
